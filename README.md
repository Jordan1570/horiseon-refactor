# Horiseon-Refactor

Description 

    Our motivation for this was to make the code more semantic and fix the functionality.

    We built this website to make the code more sematic, and to correct bugs on the website displayed. 

    This code keeps the website visually the same when you view it. It just fixes the bugs on the webpage and adds a title. 

    Making code more semantic makes the code easier to read, and it also makes the code easier to debug.

    This stands out because the code and css styling are not difficult to understand and follow.
